# winTrackr
# Project Description
winTrackr provides a platform for gambling addicts to log their scratch off winnings and losses. Users will enter the name of the scratch off that they bought, the serial number of the tickets (or entire roll), the location of purchase, and the loss or win (with win value) status of each ticket. By logging this data, users will be able to easily report gambling losses on their taxes, and see long term statistics about their gambling. 

With enough data, winTrackr will be able to create maps with hotspots of winning/losing stores and areas. We arent sure what the data will show, but with a large amount of self reported data, the website will be able to display trends and analysis for areas/stores. Additionally, the website will have leaderboards of the users. For example, there will be a biggest all-time winnings, biggest all-time losses, etc, leaderboard. 

The website will generate a page for each user, that allows them to show off their statistics on the internet (Stats such as most bought scratch off, biggest win from a ticket, biggest losing ticket, etc). If needed, the website will prompt users to upload a picture of their tickets for verification. This will probably be an optional feature, but users that upload tickets for verification will have a verified symbol next to their statistics.

Possible external sources of data for this project are the Florida lottery website. (Example: https://www.flalottery.com/scratch-offsGameDetails?gameNumber=1501)
