Sprint 2:

As a group, we got Angular and go setup. We have some basic typescript code and limited functionality. Currently the project is a demo page for Angular, but that will be changing very soon.

Cypress is setup and running correctly. We have a limited and basic unit test setup for frontend. It currently tests stepper buttons and a value change upon button press. Backend tests are limited but basically test to make sure the program is setup correctly from Cypress's point of view.

There is limited documentation available at this time. The storyboard project on the github details what is currently in progress. There are no completed tasks at this time, but there will be shortly.

As a team we plan to address the issue of getting a successful angular + go system setup. We hope to have a login page soon. So far nothing has been successfully completed.
