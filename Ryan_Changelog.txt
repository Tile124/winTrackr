+ Changed up the homepage html (app.component.html) to display two tables of
top user stats and top scratchoff game odds.

+ Added user-statistics component: This makes (and handles?) the user-statistics variables
used in app.component.html to display the the tables. This might be redundant and
I'm not sure yet on how to make it pull data from the database?

+ There is an archive folder in the client folder. This is where i'll be putting old code
incase I have to look at older versions.

+ Created this changelog to help make it easier for other people to understand the changes
I make in order.

+ Started adding some comments to files (at the top) I work on so other group members 
can understand them better.

>Summary: New user-statistics.component, modified app.component.html, app.component.ts, changelog.txt
(Only modified client folder)
>Plans: Make a dedicated login page, make a registration page, and work on the server to handle this

>Explanation: In order to meet the specifications of the project, a restructuring of the frontend needed to be done.
	The current setup makes the frontend 6 modules (includes app module). In each module, there are components 
	and other stuff needed.
>Note: The login and registration components are no longer in the app module. You can find them under Auth module.
>Plans: The homepage component hasnt been made. Need to finish the restructuring in the app module.
